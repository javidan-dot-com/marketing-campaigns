# MARKETING CAMPAIGNS

## Table of Contents

### Introduction

This is a 'marketing campaign' project that is designed to help users to create and track their campaigns. The project is built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL in the backend and React (NextJS 15) alongside TailwindCSS in the frontend. It is followed by minor E2E tests written in Cypress. The project is designed to be a full-stack application that allows users to create, update, and edit marketing campaigns.

### Setup

To run the project, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. Here are the steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/javidan-dot-com/marketing-campaigns.git`

2. Change directory to the project: `cd marketing-campaigns`

3. Run the project: `docker-compose up`

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Future Improvements

1. Add more tests to the project, especially in the backend
2. Use useContext for state management in the frontend
3. Using Alembic for database migrations
